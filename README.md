# AVL-Lab
An Adelson-Velsky and Landis self-balancing search tree created as part of CS 235

## Description
Binary search trees need to be properly balanced in order to reach optimal runtime performance. This tree re-balances each time a new element is added, making it much more effecient. It was created by me as part of a project for Data Structures at BYU.

## Usage
Use `make` in a Linux shell to compile. Running `bash ./avl` will run the main executable, which will automatically read in any files labeled file*.txt (I did not write the main method here, credit goes to the wonderful professors at BYU and their TAs). The check.sh script will compare the out_files generated by the program to key_files and output any details in details.txt
